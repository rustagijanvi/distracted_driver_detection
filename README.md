# Project Title: Distracted Driver Detection using Deep Learning
This project aims to build a robust classification model for the detection of distracted drivers based on images captured within a car. Distracted driving is a significant cause of accidents on the road, 
# Dataset :
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition, "State Farm Distracted Driver Detection" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection). It contains a large collection of driver images categorized into ten different classes, representing various distracted driving behaviors such as texting, talking on the phone, eating, and more. The dataset is an invaluable resource for training and evaluating our classification model.
# Project Goals
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Initial exploration of the dataset is required to understand its structure, size, and the distribution of classes. Data preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation will be applied to prepare the data for model training.
Model Development: We will design and implement a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to perform image classification. The model will be trained on the labeled dataset to learn and recognize different distracted driving behaviors.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the classification model will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We will also explore techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Model Optimization: To improve the model's accuracy and generalization, we may experiment with hyperparameter tuning, different architectures, and transfer learning techniques.
Deployment: Once we have a well-performing model, we can explore deployment options, such as integrating it into a mobile application or a dashboard for real-time distracted driver detection.
# Tools and Technologies used
